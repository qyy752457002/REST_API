1. GET:

    Purpose: Used to retrieve data from the server.
    Idempotent: Yes, making multiple identical GET requests should have the same effect as making a single request.
    Example: Fetching a list of articles from a blog API.

2. POST:

    Purpose: Used to submit data to the server to create a new resource.
    Idempotent: No, making multiple identical POST requests will likely create multiple new resources with different identifiers.
    Example: Creating a new user account by sending user registration data to a server.

3. PUT:

    Purpose: Used to update an existing resource or create it if it doesn't exist.
    Idempotent: Yes, making multiple identical PUT requests should have the same effect as making a single request.
    Example: Replacing the content of an article with new data.

4. PATCH:

    Purpose: Used to partially update an existing resource. It only sends the changes that need to be applied.
    Idempotent: Yes, making multiple identical PATCH requests should have the same effect as making a single request.
    Example: Updating the title of an article without modifying the entire article.

5. DELETE:

    Purpose: Used to request the removal of a resource from the server.
    Idempotent: Yes, making multiple identical DELETE requests should have the same effect as making a single request.
    Example: Deleting a user account from a database.
    These HTTP methods are fundamental to RESTful API design and are used to perform various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. When working with APIs, you choose the appropriate HTTP method based on the action you want to perform on the server's resources.
